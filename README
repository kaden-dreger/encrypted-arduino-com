Assignment 2 Part 2: Encrypted Arduino Communication

Included files:
   * assignment.2.part.2.cpp
   * README
   * Makefile

Accessories:
    * 2 Arduino Mega 2560 Boards
    * 5 wires
    * 2 resistors

Wiring Instructions:
    * Arduino [1] Pin TX3 <--> Arduino [2] Pin RX3
    * Arduino [2] Pin TX3 <--> Arduino [1] Pin RX3
    * Arduino [1] GND     <--> Arduino [2] GND
    * Resistor 1          <--> Breadboard of Arduino [1] <--> Pin 13 of Arduino [1]
    * Resistor 2          <--> Breadboard of Arduino [2] <--> Pin 13 of Arduino [2]

Running Instructions and Notes:
    In order to correctly run the program, make sure both Arduino mega boards are wired correctly and connected to the respective computers, then you must navigate to the correct directory, and call the command "make upload && serial-mon". The program will then be uploaded to your Arduino board, and the serial monitor will then be displayed on your terminal window. The program will display your unique public key, which should be exchanged automatically with your partner's public key following the handshake protocol showed in class. A shared key will then be computed, displayed, then used (as the starting key) to encrypt and decrypt each individual character that you send to the other Arduino. Each character following will be encrypted using a different key each time. You are now free to chat back and forth.
