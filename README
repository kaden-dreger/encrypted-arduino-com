Assignment 2 Part 1: Encrypted Arduino Communication

Included files:
   * ________.cpp
   * README
   * Makefile

Accessories:
    * 2 Arduino Mega 2560 Boards
    * 3 wires

Wiring Instructions:

    * Arduino [1] Pin TX3 <--> Arduino [2] Pin RX3
    * Arduino [2] Pin TX3 <--> Arduino [1] Pin RX3
    * Arduino [1] GND     <--> Arduino [2] GND

Running Instructions and Notes:

    In order to correctly run the program, make sure both Arduino mega boards are connected to the respective computers, then you must navigate to the correct directory, and call the command "make upload && serial-mon". The program will then be uploaded to your Arduino board, and the serial monitor will then be displayed on your terminal window. The program will display your unique public key, which should be exchanged with your partner's public key and inputted
    via the keyboard to the serial monitor. A shared key will then be computed and displayed, this key should be the same between you and your partner. You
    are now free to chat back and forth, the program will encrypt the character you plan to send and it will be decrypted via the other Arduino and displayed
    on your partner's serial monitor.
